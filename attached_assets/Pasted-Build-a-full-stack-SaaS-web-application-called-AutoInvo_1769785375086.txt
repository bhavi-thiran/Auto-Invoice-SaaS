Build a full-stack SaaS web application called AutoInvoice with the following features:

🌐 Core Purpose

The system allows small business owners to generate Invoices, Quotations, and Receipts by sending a WhatsApp message. The system automatically creates a PDF document with their company logo and sends it back via WhatsApp.

Use email + password authentication

Store users in a database

Each user has:

💳 Subscription & Payments

Integrate Stripe (or mock payment system for now)

3 plans:

Middleware should restrict document generation if user exceeds plan limit
